Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/[S0092867411001279];S0092867411001279;The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this listâreprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the âtumor microenvironment.â Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.
High-Resolution Microtubule Structures Reveal the Structural Transitions in @a@b-Tubulin upon GTP Hydrolysis;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/[S0092867414004838];S0092867414004838;Dynamic instability, the stochastic switching between growth and shrinkage, is essential for microtubule function. This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7â5.6Â Ã) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the Î±-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both Î±- and Î²-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces.
Role of carnitine in cancer chemotherapy-induced multiple organ toxicity;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/[S131901641000071X];S131901641000071X;AbstractIn the last few years, cancer chemotherapy has been successfully employed in the treatment of different types of human tumours. Unfortunately, the optimal clinical usefulness of this important treatment modality is usually limited secondary to the development of life-threatening multiple organ toxicity. Cancer chemotherapy may cause these toxic effects by mechanisms not involved in their anticancer activity that can severely affect the life of patients and represent a direct cause of death. Several experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that some important anticancer drugs interfere with the absorption, synthesis, and excretion of carnitine in non-tumour tissues, resulting in a secondary carnitine deficiency which is reversed by carnitine treatment without affecting anticancer therapeutic efficacy. Prototypes of anticancer drugs that alter carnitine system are doxorubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Furthermore, cachectic cancer patients are especially at risk for carnitine deficiency due to decreased oral intake and/or increased renal losses. Altered serum and urine carnitine levels have been reported in cancer patients with various forms of malignant diseases. Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that carnitine deficiency constitute a risk factor and should be viewed as a mechanism during development of oxazaphosphorines-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Similarly, inhibition of gene expression of heart fatty acid-binding protein and organic cation/carnitine transporter in doxorubicin cardiomyopathic rat model has been reported. In view of these facts and in view of irreplaceability of these important anticancer drugs, this review aimed to highlight the role of carnitine depletion and supplementation during development of chemotherapy-induced multiple organ toxicity.
